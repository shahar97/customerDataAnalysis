## Customer Data Analysis

This repository contains a project that analyzes customer data using Python and various data science libraries.

### Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to analyze customer data and gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends. The project includes the following steps:

1. Data collection: The project uses customer data from an online retail store, which is stored in a CSV file.

2. Data preprocessing: The data is preprocessed to clean and prepare it for analysis. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types.

3. Data exploration: The data is explored using visualizations and descriptive statistics to gain an understanding of the data distribution and relationships between variables.

4. Data analysis: The data is analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and insights into customer behavior and preferences. This includes analyzing customer purchase history, product preferences, and demographic information.

5. Reporting: The results of the analysis are reported using visualizations and summary statistics, along with insights and recommendations for the business.


### Libraries Used
